# Master Thesis for Master of Science in Earth and Ocean Sciences

#### Project Status: [Still in Progress]

## Project Intro
This study focuses on quantifying temporal change in the relationship between monthly degree days and monthly U.S. residential use of electricity and natural gas for each of the 48 contiguous states from 1990 to 2017.
* introduce a single degree day predicator, DD, to characterize the non-linear climate-energy link
* analyze the temporal and spatial change of the relationship based on three DD-energy use coordinates and curvature from single quadratic fits on a year-by-year and state-by-state basis
